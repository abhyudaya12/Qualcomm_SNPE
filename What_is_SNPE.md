# Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine


**SNPE is a Qualcomm Snapdragon software accelerated runtime for the execution of deep neural networks.**

## What is software accelerated runtime?

Software-accelerated runtime typically refers to the use of software techniques to enhance the performance of runtime environments or applications without relying solely on hardware acceleration.
In other words, it involves optimizing software algorithms and processes to make them run faster or more efficiently without requiring specialized hardware support.
